# Lab Scenario Preview: DP-203: Work with Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing Solutions using Azure Synapse Analytics

## Lab 14: Use Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB

### Lab overview

In this lab, you will explore about Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) is a technique for near real time analytics without a complex ETL solution. Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB enables HTAP integration between operational data in Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Synapse Analytics runtimes for Spark and SQL.


## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure an Azure Cosmos DB Account to use Azure Synapse Link.
- Create an analytical store enabled container.
- Create a linked service for Azure Cosmos DB.
- Analyze linked data using Spark.
- Analyze linked data using Synapse SQL.


## Lab 15: Use Azure Synapse Link for SQL

### Lab overview

In this lab, you will explore about Azure Synapse Link for SQL which enables low-latency synchronization of operational data in a relational database to Azure Synapse Analytics.


## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Understand key concepts and capabilities of Azure Synapse Link for SQL.
- Configure Azure Synapse Link for Azure SQL Database.
- Configure Azure Synapse Link for Microsoft SQL Server.
